UTMC 2020 will be the first ever UTMC! This means there aren't any past contests yet, but you can use these sample questions as practice. Note that these practice rounds are about as difficult as a Senior Numerical/Geometry round would be in terms of difficulty progression - Junior versions would be about two questions easier (one question easier on these samples).
