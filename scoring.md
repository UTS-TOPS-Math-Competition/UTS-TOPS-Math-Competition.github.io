## Weights
Every problem will be assigned a **weight**. This weight will essentially be the "value" of the question in "points" (for example, a problem with a weight of **3** would be worth 3 points, while a problem with a weight of **5** would be worth 5 points). In general, the more difficult a problem is, the more weight it will be given.

Note that because no problems will be proof-based, there is **no possibility for partial marks**. In fact, the answer sheets provided should be kept as clean as possible to avoid any confusion regarding the problems.

## Point Scoring
For every section, the **index** of a contestant would be the total amount of points they are awarded. We will then calculate your score as follows:
