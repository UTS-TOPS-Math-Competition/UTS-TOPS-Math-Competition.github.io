## Teams
The UTMC is done in teams of **up to 4 students**. You may either register individually or
as a team. Invidiual contestants will be grouped into teams before the day of the contest.

## Divisions
The UTMC has two divisions: Junior and Senior. The Junior division is easier, with problem
difficulties ranging from AMC 8 to AMC 10. Problem difficulties in the Senior division range
from AMC 10 to AIME. Only students in **grade 9 or below** are eligible for the Junior division.
A team competing in the Junior division must have all members be eligible
(i.e. grade 9 or below), teams with a mix of Junior and Senior students will be placed in the
Senior division.

Note that all rounds except for the Marathon Round will be separated into these two
divisions. All contestants will take the same Marathon Round, regardless of their division.
Scoring, however, will still be separate for the marathon round between the two divisions.

## Rounds
The competition consists of 4 rounds: Numerical, Geometry, Team, and Marathon. All questions
are short answer (i.e. single-value answers, no proofs). Each question has its own point-value,
which is used to calculate the total score. For more information on how the scoring works,
please refer to the [scoring procedure](/files/UTMC_Scoring_Guidelines.pdf)

### Numerical Round
This is an individual round, where you get **10 questions** and **60 minutes** to solve as many
of them you can. Problems will come from various subjects (Algebra, Combinatorics, and
Number Theory).

### Geometry Round
Similar to the Numerical Round, **10 questions** and **60 minutes**. The twist is that all
questions are geometry!

### Team Round
As the name implies, your entire team will be doing this round together. There are
**10 questions** to be solved in **40 minutes**.

### Marathon Round
The Marathon Round is also done as a team. There will be **10 sets of 3 questions**, which
your team solves sequentially (one set at a time). You'll have a total of **80 minutes** to
complete this round. You will not be told your score after submitting each set. Instead, you
will only know your final score after the round ends.

After submitting set 10, you return to set 1 and get a second chance to resubmit any answers you 
think were incorrect. If your second answer is correct, you receive half the points alloted for
the question. But be warned: Any answer submitted in this second stage will override the
original answer, *even if the original answer was correct*.
