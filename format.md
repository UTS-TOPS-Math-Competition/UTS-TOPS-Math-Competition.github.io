## Teams
The UTMC is done in teams of **up to 4 students**. You may either register individually or
as a team. Invidiual contestants will be grouped into teams before the day of the contest.

## Divisions
The UTMC has two divisions: Junior and Senior. The Junior division is easier, with problem
difficulties ranging from AMC 8 to AMC 10. Problem difficulties in the Senior division range
from AMC 10 to AIME. Only students in **grade 9 or below** are eligible for the Junior division.
A team competing in the Junior division must have all members be eligible
(i.e. grade 9 or below), teams with a mix of Junior and Senior students will be placed in the
Senior division.

Note that all rounds except for the **Marathon Round** will be separated into these two divisions. All contestants will take the same Marathon Round, regardless of their division. Scoring, however, will still be separate for the marathon round between the two divisions.

## Rounds
The competition consists of 4 rounds: Numerical, Geometry, Team, and Marathon. All questions are
short answer (i.e. single-value answers, no proofs). Note that every question will be **weighted a certain amount of points**. This amount will be displayed at the beginning of the question in brackets (i.e. [5]). For more information on how the scoring system works, please refer to the **Scoring** page of this website.

### Numerical Round
This is an individual round, where you get **10 questions** and **60 minutes** to solve as many
of them you can. Problems will come from various subjects (Algebra, Combinatorics, and
Number Theory).

### Geometry Round
Similar to the Numerical Round, **10 questions** and **60 minutes**. The twist is that all
questions are geometry!

### Team Round
As the name implies, your entire team will be doing this round together. There are
**10 questions** to be solved in **40 minutes**.

### Marathon Round
The Marathon Round is also done as a team. There will be **10 sets of 3 questions**, which
your team solves sequentially (one set at a time). You'll have a total of **80 minutes** to
complete this round. Note that at any given moment you will **not be able to know your score** thus far (this is different from many other contests, so keep this in mind).

Once you submit set 10, you will  return to set 1 and get a second chance to resubmit any answers you 
think were incorrect. An answer submitted in this second stage will override the original answer
given, and will only be worth half the points, if correct. A few examples of how this would work:

1. If you go back to set 1 (which you think was completely correct) and decide to resubmit no answers, your score would remain the same.

2. If you go back to set 1, which was originally completely correct, and resumit an incorrect answer for the first question, you will now have **0** points for that question (instead of the given weight).

3. If you go back to set 1, which originally contained an incorrect first question, and then submitted another incorrect response to the first question, your score would remain the same for that question.
