This means there aren’t any past contests yet, but you can use these sample questions as practice.\n\nNote that these practice rounds are about as difficult as a Senior Numerical/Geometry round would be in terms of difficulty progression - Junior versions would be about two questions easier (one question easier on these samples).\n\nNumerical Round\nSample Problems\n\nGeometry Round\nSample Problems\n\n",

The individual awards are solely based on an individual’s performance on the\nNumerical and Geometry Rounds, while the team awards reflect the overall performance of the\nentire team.\n\nPrizes\nFor each of the categories listed above, the following prizes will be awarded:\n\n100 dollars for the first place individual/team in the category.\n\n50 dollars for the second place individual/team in the category.\n\n25 dollars for the third place individual/team in the category.\n\nIn addition, all participants will receive participation gifts during the contest. These gifts may include stationery, pencil cases, and puzzles!\n\nScoring\nThe scoring procedure is described here.\n",

    "content": "Teams\nThe UTMC is done in teams of up to 4 students. You may either register individually or\nas a team. Invidiual contestants will be grouped into teams before the day of the contest.\n\nDivisions\nThe UTMC has two divisions: Junior and Senior. The Junior division is easier, with problem\ndifficulties ranging from AMC 8 to AMC 10. Problem difficulties in the Senior division range\nfrom AMC 10 to AIME. Only students in grade 9 or below are eligible for the Junior division.\nA team competing in the Junior division must have all members be eligible\n(i.e. grade 9 or below), teams with a mix of Junior and Senior students will be placed in the\nSenior division.\n\nNote that all rounds except for the Marathon Round will be separated into these two\ndivisions. All contestants will take the same Marathon Round, regardless of their division.\nScoring, however, will still be separate for the marathon round between the two divisions.\n\nRounds\nThe competition consists of 4 rounds: Numerical, Geometry, Team, and Marathon. All questions\nare short answer (i.e. single-value answers, no proofs). Each question has its own point-value,\nwhich is used to calculate the total score. For more information on how the scoring works,\nplease refer to the scoring procedure\n\nNumerical Round\nThis is an individual round, where you get 10 questions and 60 minutes to solve as many\nof them you can. Problems will come from various subjects (Algebra, Combinatorics, and\nNumber Theory).\n\nGeometry Round\nSimilar to the Numerical Round, 10 questions and 60 minutes. The twist is that all\nquestions are geometry!\n\nTeam Round\nAs the name implies, your entire team will be doing this round together. There are\n10 questions to be solved in 40 minutes.\n\nMarathon Round\nThe Marathon Round is also done as a team. There will be 10 sets of 3 questions, which\nyour team solves sequentially (one set at a time). You’ll have a total of 80 minutes to\ncomplete this round. You will not be told your score after submitting each set. Instead, you\nwill only know your final score after the round ends.\n\nAfter submitting set 10, you return to set 1 and get a second chance to resubmit any answers you \nthink were incorrect. If your second answer is correct, you receive half the points alloted for\nthe question. But be warned: Any answer submitted in this second stage will override the\noriginal answer, even if the original answer was correct.\n",

    "content": "Acceptable Answers\nThis guideline describes which answers are acceptable\non the contest (e.g. simplification rules).\n\nMathematical Aids\nThe only mathematical aids allowed in the competition are rulers and compasses. No protractors are allowed. All electronics will not be allowed for use. This includes any kind of calculator, computer, or phone. Abaci and other mechanical computational aids are also prohibited. Finally, students are not allowed to bring their own scrap paper (including graph paper). Paper will be provided at the contest site for rough work.\n\nIf a student has a computational aid they wish to use, they must confirm with the UTMC Committee before using it on the contest.\n\nProtests\nIf a student believes that the provided answer to a problem is incorrect, they are allowed to check with the UTMC Committee. The deadline to do so will be announced on the day of the contest.\n",
