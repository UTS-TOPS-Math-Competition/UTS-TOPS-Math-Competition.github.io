    "content": "Teams\nThe UTMC is done in teams of up to 4 students. You may either register individually or\nas a team. Invidiual contestants will be grouped into teams before the day of the contest.\n\nDivisions\nThe UTMC has two divisions: Junior and Senior. The Junior division is easier, with problem\ndifficulties ranging from AMC 8 to AMC 10. Problem difficulties in the Senior division range\nfrom AMC 10 to AIME. Only students in grade 9 or below are eligible for the Junior division.\nA team competing in the Junior division must have all members be eligible\n(i.e. grade 9 or below), teams with a mix of Junior and Senior students will be placed in the\nSenior division.\n\nRounds\nThe competition consists of 4 rounds: Numerical, Geometry, Team, and Marathon. All questions are\nshort answer (i.e. single-value answers, no proofs). Note that every question will be weighted a certain amount of points. This amount will be displayed at the beginning of the question in brackets (i.e. [5]). For more information on how the scoring system works, please refer to the Scoring page of this website.\n\nNumerical Round\nThis is an individual round, where you get 10 questions and 60 minutes to solve as many\nof them you can. Problems will come from various subjects (Algebra, Combinatorics, and\nNumber Theory).\n\nGeometry Round\nSimilar to the Numerical Round, 10 questions and 60 minutes. The twist is that all\nquestions are geometry!\n\nTeam Round\nAs the name implies, your entire team will be doing this round together. There are\n10 questions to be solved in 40 minutes.\n\nMarathon Round\nThe Marathon Round is also done as a team. There will be 10 sets of 3 questions, which\nyour team solves sequentially (one set at a time). You’ll have a total of 80 minutes to\ncomplete this round. Note that at any given moment you will not be able to know your score thus far (this is different from many other contests, so keep this in mind).\n\nOnce you submit set 10, you will  return to set 1 and get a second chance to resubmit any answers you \nthink were incorrect. An answer submitted in this second stage will override the original answer\ngiven, and will only be worth half the points, if correct. A few examples of how this would work:\n\n\n  \n    If you go back to set 1 (which you think was completely correct) and decide to resubmit no answers, your score would remain the same.\n  \n  \n    If you go back to set 1, which was originally completely correct, and resumit an incorrect answer for the first question, you will now have 0 points for that question (instead of the given weight).\n  \n  \n    If you go back to set 1, which originally contained an incorrect first question, and then submitted another incorrect response to the first question, your score would remain the same for that question.\n  \n\n",

    "content": "Weights\nEvery problem will be assigned a weight. This weight will essentially be the “value” of the question in “points” (for example, a problem with a weight of 3 would be worth 3 points, while a problem with a weight of 5 would be worth 5 points). In general, the more difficult a problem is, the more weight it will be given.\n\nNote that because no problems will be proof-based, there is no possibility for partial marks. In fact, the answer sheets provided should be kept as clean as possible to avoid any confusion regarding the problems.\n\nPoint Scoring\nFor every section, the index of a contestant would be the total amount of points they are awarded. We will then calculate your score as follows:\n",
