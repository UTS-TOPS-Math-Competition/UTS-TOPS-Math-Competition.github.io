    "content": "Teams\nThe UTMC is done in teams of up to 4 students. You may either register individually or\nas a team. Invidiual contestants will be grouped into teams before the day of the contest.\n\nDivisions\nThe UTMC has two divisions: Junior and Senior. The Junior division is easier, with problem\ndifficulties ranging from AMC 8 to AMC 10. Problem difficulties in the Senior division range\nfrom AMC 10 to AIME. Only students in grade 9 or below are eligible for the Junior division.\nA team competing in the Junior division must have all members be eligible\n(i.e. grade 9 or below), teams with a mix of Junior and Senior students will be placed in the\nSenior division.\n\nRounds\nThe competition consists of 4 rounds: Numerical, Geometry, Team, and Marathon. All questions are\nshort answer (i.e. single-value answers, no proofs).\n\nNumerical Round\nThis is an individual round, where you get 10 questions and 60 minutes to solve as many\nof them you can. Problems will come from various subjects (Algebra, Combinatorics, and\nNumber Theory).\n\nGeometry Round\nSimilar to the Numerical Round, 10 questions and 60 minutes. The twist is that all\nquestions are geometry!\n\nTeam Round\nAs the name implies, your entire team will be doing this round together. There are\n10 questions to be solved in 40 minutes.\n\nMarathon Round\nThe Marathon Round is also done as a team. There will be 10 sets of 3 questions, which\nyour team solves sequentially (one set at a time). You’ll have a total of 80 minutes to\ncomplete this round.\n\n[add explanation of lock mechanism here]\n",
