    "content": "Award Categories\nThere will be 2 categories for awards: Top Contestants, and Sweepstakes. Top Contestants will be a strictly individual award, while Sweepstakes will reflect the overall performance of the entire team. Note that both categories will be separated between the Junior and Senior divisions, although both divisions will share an award ceremony.\n\nPrizes\nFor each of the aforementioned categories (Junior Top Contestants, Senior Top Contestants, Junior Sweepstakes, Senior Sweepstakes), the following prizes will be awarded:\n\n100 dollars for the first place individual/team in the category.\n\n50 dollars for the second place individual/team in the category.\n\n25 dollars for the third place individual/team in the category.\n\nIn addition, all participants will receive participation gifts during the contest. These gifts may include stationery, pencil cases, and puzzles!\n\nScoring\nThe scoring procedure is described here.\n",

    "content": "Teams\nThe UTMC is done in teams of up to 4 students. You may either register individually or\nas a team. Invidiual contestants will be grouped into teams before the day of the contest.\n\nDivisions\nThe UTMC has two divisions: Junior and Senior. The Junior division is easier, with problem\ndifficulties ranging from AMC 8 to AMC 10. Problem difficulties in the Senior division range\nfrom AMC 10 to AIME. Only students in grade 9 or below are eligible for the Junior division.\nA team competing in the Junior division must have all members be eligible\n(i.e. grade 9 or below), teams with a mix of Junior and Senior students will be placed in the\nSenior division.\n\nRounds\nThe competition consists of 4 rounds: Numerical, Geometry, Team, and Marathon. All questions are\nshort answer (i.e. single-value answers, no proofs). Note that every question will be weighted a certain amount of points. This amount will be displayed at the beginning of the question in brackets (i.e. [5]). For more information on how the scoring system works, please refer to the Scoring page of this website.\n\nNumerical Round\nThis is an individual round, where you get 10 questions and 60 minutes to solve as many\nof them you can. Problems will come from various subjects (Algebra, Combinatorics, and\nNumber Theory).\n\nGeometry Round\nSimilar to the Numerical Round, 10 questions and 60 minutes. The twist is that all\nquestions are geometry!\n\nTeam Round\nAs the name implies, your entire team will be doing this round together. There are\n10 questions to be solved in 40 minutes.\n\nMarathon Round\nThe Marathon Round is also done as a team. There will be 10 sets of 3 questions, which\nyour team solves sequentially (one set at a time). You’ll have a total of 80 minutes to\ncomplete this round. Note that at any given moment you will not be able to know your score thus far (this is different from many other contests, so keep this in mind).\n\nOnce you submit set 10, you will  return to set 1 and get a second chance to resubmit any answers you \nthink were incorrect. An answer submitted in this second stage will override the original answer\ngiven, and will only be worth half the points, if correct. A few examples of how this would work:\n\n\n  \n    If you go back to set 1 (which you think was completely correct) and decide to resubmit no answers, your score would remain the same.\n  \n  \n    If you go back to set 1, which was originally completely correct, and resumit an incorrect answer for the first question, you will now have 0 points for that question (instead of the given weight).\n  \n  \n    If you go back to set 1, which originally contained an incorrect first question, and then submitted another incorrect response to the first question, your score would remain the same for that question.\n  \n\n",

    "content": "General Guidelines\nA few basic guidelines to be followed:\n\n  Do not flip over the contest page until you are told to begin.\n  Write all your answers in the answer sheet provided. Any work not written within the designated answer sheets will not be considered.\n  Remember to sign your name and team name on the answer sheet, to ensure that your answers get recorded properly. If no name is given, then your answers will not be marked.\n\n\nNote that all these guidelines, along with the rules below, will be reviewed by the proctors before each and every round. If any of these guidelines are broken, the individual/team that has broken the rule will receive an automatic 0 points for that round. They will be informed of this, and may still participate in the round (without gaining any points). This will not affect their score in other rounds.\n\nMathematical Aids\nThe only mathematical aids allowed in the competition are rulers and compasses. No protractors are allowed. All electronics will not be allowed for use. This includes any kind of calculator, computer, or phone. Abaci and other mechanical computational aids are also prohibited. Finally, students are not allowed to bring their own scrap paper (including graph paper). Paper will be provided at the contest site for rough work, in case students are in need of it.\n\nAcceptable Answers\nA guideline towards which answers are accepted on the exam are provided below:\n\nProtests\nIf any student has a computational aid they wish to use, they must confirm with the UTMC Committee if they are to use it.\n\nIf a student believes that the provided answer to a problem is incorrect, they are allowed to check with the UTMC Committee. The deadline to do so will be announced on the day of the contest.\n",
