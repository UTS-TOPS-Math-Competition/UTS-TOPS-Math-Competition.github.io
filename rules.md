## General Guidelines
A few basic guidelines to be followed:
1. Do not flip over the contest page until you are told to begin.
2. Write all your answers in the answer sheet provided. If your answers are written anywhere else,
If any of these guidelines are broken, the individual/team that has broken the rule will receive an automatic **0** points for that round. They will be informed of this, and may still participate in the round (without gaining any points). This will not affect their score in other rounds.

## Mathematical Aids
The only mathematical aids allowed in the competition are rulers and compasses. No protractors are allowed. All electronics will not be allowed for use. This includes any kind of calculator, computer, or phone. Abaci and other mechanical computational aids are also prohibited. Finally, students are not allowed to bring their own scrap paper (including graph paper). Paper will be provided at the contest site for rough work, in case students are in need of it.

## Acceptable Answers

## Protests
If any student has a computational aid they wish to use, they must confirm with the UTMC Committee if they are to use it.

If a student believes that the provided answer to a problem is incorrect, they are allowed to check with the UTMC Committee. The deadline to do so will be announced on the day of the contest.
