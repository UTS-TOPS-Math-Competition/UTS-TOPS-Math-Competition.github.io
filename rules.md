## Acceptable Answers
[This guideline](/files/UTMC_Acceptable_Answers.pdf) describes which answers are acceptable
on the contest (e.g. simplification rules).

## Mathematical Aids
The only mathematical aids allowed in the competition are rulers and compasses. No protractors are allowed. All electronics will not be allowed for use. This includes any kind of calculator, computer, or phone. Abaci and other mechanical computational aids are also prohibited. Finally, students are not allowed to bring their own scrap paper (including graph paper). Paper will be provided at the contest site for rough work.

If a student has a computational aid they wish to use, they must confirm with the UTMC Committee before using it on the contest.

## Protests
If a student believes that the provided answer to a problem is incorrect, they are allowed to check with the UTMC Committee. The deadline to do so will be announced on the day of the contest.
